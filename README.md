# SQLGuard
SQLGuard base build scripts and SSIS Solution. This is a collection of what I use at times and is quite helpful for managing SQL environments

1. The basebuild solution can be customised for any enviroment and is a collection of scripts which will help you do perform DBA tasks. Some scripts are from OLA and OZAR which I love to use, the build will postiion these into a base DB and not the master DB. Rename as you like.
